              I started a new journey of my life in Anwar-u-Mustafa, and it
              changed my life. I passed the fifth class from there. After Anwar
              School, I further studied at Paras College Kandiaro, which made me
              better than before. I continued my studies in the same college
              until passing my intermediate in engineering, and I experienced
              the best days of my life there with the best teachers. Now, I am a
              student at NED University Tharparkar Campus, Mithi, in the
              Computer Science department, where I am learning the experience of
              life. From my journey, my dreams have evolved over time. Starting
              with building a strong educational foundation in my early years, I
              developed a passion for technical and scientific fields during my
              intermediate studies. Now, as a Computer Science student, my dream
              is to become a skilled software engineer or developer, using
              technology to solve real-world problems and make a meaningful
              impact in the tech industry.
